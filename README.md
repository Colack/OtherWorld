# OtherWorld
Welcome to OtherWorld, a chat/social media app inspired by the former [WUT] World project! This app is designed with advanced security protocols to ensure the privacy and safety of its users.

## To-Do List
Here are the key components that we are working on to make OtherWorld a great app:

- #### User Backend
  The user backend will manage all user data, including registration, authentication, and account settings.
- #### User Frontend
  The user frontend will be the main interface that users interact with, including profile pages, messaging, and other social media features.
- #### Security Library
  The security library will handle all aspects of data security, including encryption, token management, and other security protocols to ensure user data is secure.
- #### Graphics
  We are working on designing and implementing the graphics for OtherWorld to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
- #### Bot System
  A bot system will allow automated interactions between users, providing additional features and functionality to the app.
- #### Roles
  Roles will define the different levels of access and permissions for users within the app, including moderators, administrators, and other user groups.
- #### NamePlates
  Nameplates are customizable name tags that users can apply to their profile to personalize their account and express themselves in a unique way.
- #### Servers
  The servers will host the app and manage all incoming and outgoing data, providing a seamless experience for users.
- #### Chatrooms
  Chatrooms will allow users to join and participate in various conversations with other users, promoting social interaction and community building within the app.
- #### Hosting
  OtherWorld is hosted on Code.org (possibly not), ensuring a reliable and secure platform for our users.
